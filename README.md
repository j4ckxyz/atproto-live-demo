# AT Protocol Live Demo

An interactive web demonstration of the AT Protocol (ATProto), the decentralized social media protocol behind Bluesky.

## What is AT Protocol?

The AT Protocol separates your social media data from the apps you use, giving you ownership and control. Think of it like email: you can switch between different clients (apps) while keeping your data and identity.

## Features

- **Interactive Playground**: Click through the steps to see how data flows through the AT Protocol ecosystem
- **Visual Diagram**: Animated visualization of the protocol components:
  - Personal Data Servers (PDS)
  - Relay (network firehose)
  - AppView (social index)
  - Client apps

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Click the numbered buttons in sequence to simulate the protocol flow:
   - Alice makes a post
   - Network indexes the post
   - Bob checks his timeline
3. Use the Reset button to start over

## Deployment
